- Objectives:
    1. Develop a web application using Spring Boot that allows users to search and book rental properties.
    2. Provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for tenants to search for properties based on location, price, number of bedrooms, and other criteria.
    3. Provide landlords and property managers with a dashboard to manage their properties, including viewing tenant applications, updating property information, and            accepting rent payments.
